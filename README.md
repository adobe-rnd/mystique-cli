# Coda: AI-Powered Coding Assistant

## Overview

This command line tool is a general-purpose AI-powered coding assistant that makes it super easy to generate, modify, and enhance code. By using Generative AI, it helps developers quickly create, tweak, and improve various code components. It's a simple project designed to show how easy it is to build such a tool from scratch and also to serve as a foundation for custom implementations.

## Installation

To install the command line tool from PyPI, run:

```bash
pip install coda-ai-assistant
```

## Configuration

When you first run the tool, it will automatically create a `config.json` file in the `.coda` directory in your project's root. You don't need to create this file manually - the application will guide you through the setup process by prompting you to:

1. Choose your preferred API provider (OpenAI or Azure)
2. Enter the necessary API keys and configuration values
3. Save the configuration automatically

## Usage

To use the command line tool, execute the following command from the root directory of the project you want to modify:

```bash
coda
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the tool, generate code, and apply changes to your project.
